# Antisaccade-Task-Model
Competitive neural network simulating neural activity in the superior colliculus responsible for saccadic eye movements

In this repo you will find:

Two ipynb files that represent the code created in Jupyter Notebook:

	- (Main Code) The first contains the main code used to generate the simulations, trials, and graphs.
	  It also contains the latency distributions for the PD and MSA conditions, as well as the error
	  rates and rates of error correction for the schizophrenia and control condition.

	- (Latency Distributions + PD and MSA Error Rates) The other contains the latency distributions for
	  the schizophrenia and control conditions, as well as the error rates for PD and MSA.

	Note: The PD Error Rate at T1 is on the first file, "Main Code," instead of the second file.

Powerpoint Presentation

Final Report/Paper both in Microsoft Word and as a PDF

All code is by me, no code was used from any public repositories, nor any was provided or used from the studies.
